## [OSRF Profile](https://hub.docker.com/u/osrf/)

The following repos are hosted under the OSRF Organization on Docker Hub. These images are tagged for development and advanced use cases. If you require extra dependencies not available from the Official Library images above, then using these images may help save you build time during continuous integration or local development.

### [ROS ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/osrf/ros.svg?label=pulls) ![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/osrf/ros.svg?label=stars)](https://hub.docker.com/r/osrf/ros/)

This repo builds `FROM` the Official Library by including additional meta-packages such for desktop installations. These images may be helpful using containers for development or when display forwarding when using GUIs.
